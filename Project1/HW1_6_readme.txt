Project title:
Decision_classifier

Running and testing:
With hw1data.mat in the same folder. Simply shift + enter to run the script.
To vary the trainning data and test data size, simply change the number of "size_to_test" at the end of the main function. The code will take a little while, because it will build multiple classifiers based on a list of K. After running, you will get a plot about the error rate vs. K of this prediction. This is our answer to our first two parts of Problem 6. Addtionally, if you want to change K, then you should change them in the "Build_classifier_based_on_K_and_Plot" function.
