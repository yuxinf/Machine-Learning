Project title:
Bayesian_classifier

Running and testing:
To vary the trainning data and test data size, simply change the number of trainningdata at the end of the script. After running, you will get the accuracy of this prediction. 


Project title:
KNN_classifier

Running and testing:
To vary the trainning data and test data size, simply change the value of knntrainnum and knntestnum = at the beginning of the script. After running, you will get the accuracy of this prediction. 

Project title:
Decision_classifier

Running and testing:
With hw1data.mat in the same folder. Simply shift + enter to run the script.
To vary the trainning data and test data size, simply change the number of "size_to_test" at the end of the main function. The code will take a little while, because it will build multiple classifiers based on a list of K. After running, you will get a plot about the error rate vs. K of this prediction. This is our answer to our first two parts of Problem 6. Addtionally, if you want to change K, then you should change them in the "Build_classifier_based_on_K_and_Plot" function.
